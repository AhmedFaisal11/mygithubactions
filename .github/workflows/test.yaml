# firstly github action require a name for a particular action
name: my first github action
# this line will tell github action that when somebody pushes into github repo just automatically run this action
# you can also define other on actions for example on : pull_requests 
on: push
#the last but not the least thing github action require is the jobs it need to perform on a certain action
jobs:
    builds-app: # this is our first job
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest # this is the underlying image on which your action runs
        steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v2 # this built in action will checkout the repo and clone it on our os in this case ubuntu
            - uses: actions/setup-node@v2 # this will install node js on that os with version 17
              with:
                node-version: '17'
            #this task will install all dependencies required by project
            - name: install dependencies 
              run: yarn install
            # this task will build the project
            - name: build the project
              run: yarn build
            # this will return list of all the files/folders in that project folder
            - run: ls
    second-job:
        needs: builds-app # this job is dependent on builds-app because in some cases you want to run second after completing first you dont want it to run parallel that why we use needs keyword for making a job dependent on another job in this case build-app
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - run: echo "Hello world"
